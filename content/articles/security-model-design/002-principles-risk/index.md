No matter the system design, there will always be some risk to the content. If human eyes can see a movie, so can a machine designed to steal that movie. The system designer needs to find the optimal level of risk for a solution, balancing cost and benefit.

Content owners understand this perfectly well and this fact as at the core of their content licensing business. A perfect system is not possible to build and nobody expects a solution author to provide an unbreakable solution.

Let's review some examples of common risks that a solution author might encounter. For each risk, I provide basic guidance on how to deal with it in a cost-efficient way. Some of them may be further explored in future articles.
