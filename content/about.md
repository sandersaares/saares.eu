I strive to make machines serve mankind. There is much untapped potential in the technology base already available to us that can transform humanity if utilized in the right way at the right time.

My day job is at [Axinom](https://axinom.com), a company that creates solutions for in-flight entertainment and online streaming. In my role as advisor I deal with a wide range of topics including:

* technical product design and information architecture
* designing modern adaptive streaming workflows, from encoding and packaging to delivery and player integration
* achieving Hollywood-grade content security in line with [MPAA best practices](https://www.mpaa.org/what-we-do/advancing-creativity/additional-resources/#content-protection-best-practices)
* contributing to industry specifications on media streaming technologies
* understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing systems on architecture, operating system, database and algorithm levels
* mentoring colleagues in applying modern techniques and practices
* exploratory research and development

I am the maintainer of the [prometheus-net](https://github.com/prometheus-net/prometheus-net) metrics library, which I use in my daily work. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) is a great solution for monitoring and metrics that often I use in order to obtain a deep understanding of the information systems I work with.

On my free time, I enjoy consuming books and practice cycling and archery. I believe the future of humanity is in the wide open spaces between planets and am an avid fan of the heavy-lift spaceflight industry that can open the door to our destiny. I wish I could contribute more to that industry but it falls rather far from my skillset so I remain a bystander.

This website is a collection of thoughts that I feel like sharing, thoughts that may prove useful to someone. The set of topics is fairly arbitrary, though I try to curate it a bit for easy readability.
